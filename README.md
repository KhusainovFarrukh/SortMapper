## Description 📝

Hi! This is **SortMapper**. 🎉 
SortMapper is powerful library for mapping sort parameters on Spring applications. 

It enables you to implement sorting functionality with ease, especially for complex, nested fields within entities and flat response models.
By using custom annotations, SortMapper allows for a seamless integration of mappings for sort parameters. 
SortMapper also includes validation layer to prevent invalid sort parameters to achieve your Repository layer, ensuring cleaner, more reliable query handling.

With SortMapper, you can enhance your API’s sorting capabilities, creating a more robust and user-friendly experience.

## Releases 📦

Current version is v0.0.1.

You can see changes and earlier versions on [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/KhusainovFarrukh/SortMapper/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

## Features 📊

- Mapping sort parameters
- Validation invalid sort parameters

## Installation ⚙️

Simply add to your dependencies list. For example, in Gradle:

```
dependencies {
    //Other dependencies...

    //SortMapper
    implementation("io.github.khusainovfarrukh:sort-mapper:0.0.1")
}
```

## Usage 🛠️

Add @SortMapping annotation to method/function for which you want to enable mapping:

P/S: entity is optional. you can read about it on javadocs/comments written on @SortMapping source code

```kotlin
    @SortMapping(entity = LessonEntity::class)
    @GetMapping
    @Operation(summary = "Get all lessons")
    fun getAllLessons(pageable: Pageable): ResponseEntity<PagedModel<LessonResponseDTO>>
```

On your response model map your sort parameters with @SortField annoation. In our example LessonResponseDTO looks like:

```kotlin
data class LessonResponseDTO(
    val id: Long,
    val title: String,
    val description: String?,
    val courseId: Long,
    val courseTitle: String,
    @SortField("course.teacher.firstName")
    val teacherFirstName: String,
    @SortField("course.teacher.lastName")
    val teacherLastName: String,
    val helperTeacherId: Long?,
    val helperTeacherFirstName: String?,
    val helperTeacherLastName: String?
)
```

That's all! You are ready to use SortMapper! 🎉

Also you can configure it using application.yml (.properties) file. Default values are:

```yaml
sort-mapper:
  work-mode: ENABLED
  param-validation-type: SOFT
  exception:
    handler-enabled: true
    http-code: 400
    stacktrace-enabled: true
```
See source code for detailed documentation.
